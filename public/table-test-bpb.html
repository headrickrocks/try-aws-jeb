                <p>A jury on Thursday evening found Angel Bumpass, who was 13 at the time, guilty of first-degree felony murder and attempt to commit especially aggravated robbery 
                    in the 2009 killing of 68-year-old Franklin Bonner. Mallory Vaughn, her co-defendant, was found not guilty on both counts. Bonner's wife, Linda, was the one who found him lying on the floor, 
                    bound to a kitchen table and chair inside their Washington Hills home on Jan. 16, 2009. He had duct tape around his feet, arms and head, nose and mouth. Suffocation was the cause of death, Hamilton 
                    County Medical Examiner Dr. James Metcalfe later determined. The case had gone cold up until 2018 when Franklin Bonner's relatives called prosecutors asking them to take another look. They did, and 
                    got a match for two fingerprints found at the scene. The match was for Bumpass, who is now 24.</p>
